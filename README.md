## üìå What is HPC?

**High Performance Computing (HPC)** is the practice of using supercomputers and parallel processing techniques to solve complex computational problems faster than traditional machines can handle. It enables large-scale simulations, scientific computing, big data analysis, and advanced machine learning workloads.

## ‚ö° Why Do We Need HPC?

Modern challenges ‚Äî climate modeling, bioinformatics, autonomous systems, deep learning ‚Äî demand extreme processing power and scalability. HPC makes it possible to:
- Perform trillions of operations per second.
- Run compute-heavy tasks efficiently.
- Reduce execution time for research and production workloads.
- Optimize algorithms for CPU and GPU architectures.
